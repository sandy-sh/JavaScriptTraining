# JavaScriptTraining 🚀

A personal collection of focused JavaScript challenges and solutions completed while learning on **freeCodeCamp**. This repository is intended as a concise, easy-to-browse archive of small programs and algorithm exercises used to practice JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving.

## ✅ What you'll find here

- Small, self-contained JavaScript examples organized by topic
- Algorithm and logic exercises with readable, beginner-friendly code
- Short programs intended for learning, experimentation, and reference

## 📂 Project structure

Top-level folders group challenges by topic. Examples:

- `Array/` — array-related exercises
- `Function/` — function and scope problems
- Individual files (e.g., `card-counter.js`, `LeapYearCalculator.js`) are standalone examples

> Note: Files are simple, runnable examples rather than production-ready libraries.

## ⚡ Quick start

1. Install Node.js (v12+ recommended).
2. From the repository root run a single example:

```bash
node Function/CelsiustoFahrenheitConverter.js
```

3. Open files in VS Code or run them with `node` to experiment and modify behavior.

## ✍️ Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please keep changes focused and small:

1. Add or update a single example per pull request
2. Name files descriptively and include brief comments explaining the approach
3. Open an issue or PR if you'd like feedback or want to propose a refactor
