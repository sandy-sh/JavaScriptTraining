/*
User Stories:

1. You should create a function called generatePassword that takes a parameter, 
indicating the length of generated password. You can name the parameter whatever you like.
2. Your function should return a string which represents a randomly generated password. 
You should use the following string and different Math methods to help you return a new string 
with random characters in it: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*().
3. You should define a variable called password and assign it the result of calling the generatePassword function 
with a numeric argument that represents the desired password length.
4. You should have a console.log that logs a single string made by concatenating the message 
Generated password: and the password variable separated by a space.

function generatePassword (length) {
    const pool = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()";
    let password = "";

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        let index = Math.floor(Math.random() * pool.length);
        password += pool[index];
    }

    return password;
}

const password = generatePassword(4);

console.log(`Generated password: ${password}`);
